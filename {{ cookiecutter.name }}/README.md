# {{ cookiecutter.name }}


## Usage

Open the `{{ cookiecutter.name }}.code-workspace` in Visual Studio Code.  This contains all extensions you will need for automatic linting and managing the project.

Add your projects to the `packages` folder.  If the `packages` folder does not already exist, create it.  See below for the expected project structure.

```
ðŸ“¦ {{ cookiecutter.name }}
 â”£ ...
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ packages
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ project-a
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚ project-b
 â”— ...
```
This monorepo uses npm workspaces.  See [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) for more information on how to interact with workspaces.
